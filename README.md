# To Do list basic

**About:**

A basic "to do list", the interface was made to work with shadows and React.js, this repository is just a basic structure of what I really intend to do later, when I have access to a computer/notebook, for now this repository is like the others, made 100% on a cell phone, accessible only on mobile.

**Using:**
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React.js - _vers√£o: 17.0.1_
